            elif choice == '4':
                print("Result:", divide(num1, num2))
            elif choice == '5':
                print("Result:", exponentiate(num1, num2))
        elif choice == '6':
            print("Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid option.")

**Project Documentation: Python Chatbot**

**1. Introduction:**
This project implements a Python chatbot capable of engaging in conversation with users. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques to interpret user queries accurately and respond appropriately. It aims to provide relevant information or assistance, contributing to a seamless user experience.

**2. Features:**
- Natural Language Understanding: The chatbot is capable of understanding natural language input from users.
- Contextually Relevant Responses: Responses generated by the chatbot are contextually relevant to the user's queries.
- Seamless User Experience: The chatbot aims to provide a seamless user experience by engaging in meaningful conversations and providing assistance as needed.

**3. Code Explanation:**

```python
import random

# Define responses for different types of user inputs
responses = {
    "greetings": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey!"],
    "farewell": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Bye!"],
    "thanks": ["You're welcome!", "No problem!", "Anytime!"],
    "default": ["I'm sorry, I didn't understand that.", "Could you please rephrase that?", "I'm not sure I follow."],
}

# Function to generate a response based on user input
def generate_response(user_input):
    user_input = user_input.lower()  # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching

    # Check for specific keywords in user input to determine the appropriate response
    if any(word in user_input for word in ["hello", "hi", "hey", "howdy"]):
        return random.choice(responses["greetings"])
    elif any(word in user_input for word in ["bye", "goodbye"]):
        return random.choice(responses["farewell"])
    elif any(word in user_input for word in ["thanks", "thank you"]):
        return random.choice(responses["thanks"])
    else:
        return random.choice(responses["default"])

# Main function to run the chatbot
def chatbot():
    print("Welcome! How can I assist you today?")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")

        # Check if user wants to exit the conversation
        if user_input.lower() in ["exit", "quit", "goodbye"]:
            print("Chatbot: " + random.choice(responses["farewell"]))
            break

        # Generate a response based on user input
        response = generate_response(user_input)
        print("Chatbot:", response)

# Run the chatbot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```

**4. Execution:**
- When the program is run, the chatbot welcomes the user and prompts for input.
- The user inputs a query or message.
- Based on the user's input, the chatbot generates an appropriate response.
- The conversation continues until the user chooses to exit.

**5. User Interaction:**

user interaction deals with code written part and output is handled .

**6. Conclusion:**
This Python chatbot provides a simple yet effective way to engage in conversation with users. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to interpret user queries and generate contextually relevant responses, contributing to a seamless user experience.

**7. Future Improvements:**
- Integration with APIs for retrieving real-time information.
- Implementation of more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for better understanding and response generation.
- Addition of functionality to handle more complex user queries and tasks.

**Note:**  
This documentation provides an overview of the Python chatbot project, including its features, code explanation, execution, user interaction, and potential improvements. It aims to facilitate understanding and usage of the chatbot for engaging conversations with users.
